        <p>Click to edit education descriptionMy emphases were in alternative transportation research, statistical analysis, and GIS, but other major themes of the program included environmental communication, research design, and reporting. For my capstone project, I designed and implemented a bicycle network assessment in St. Louis, MO. To generate data, I surveyed over 90 local cyclists about how much stress they felt on their daily bike routes. I then collected and synthesized large sets of street and traffic data from various local organizations. Through statistical and spatial analysis, I was able to map high- and low-stress bicycle routes throughout the study area and determine which environmental variables were correlated with cyclist stress. I presented my study in December 2015 and am currently editing my paper for publication.</p>
